Music is always changing and the changes are always unpredictable. — Billy Sheehan

INTRODUCTION

According to the famous American bassist, it’s challenging to anticipate the constantly occurring changes in music. An interdisciplinary field called music information retrieval (MIR) studies various facets of information extraction from music. Music genre classification is one of the sub-problems of the music annotation domain being explored by these developments.

A music genre is a term used to categorize certain types of music according to a shared tradition or set of rules. A genre categorization system’s objective is to correctly assign a music genre to an unidentified song recording.

The two most crucial components for music genre classification are:

Feature Extraction
Classifier Learning
The focus of feature extraction is on finding appropriate representations of samples that are anticipated to be categorized using feature vectors or pairwise similarities. Following features and musical representations are used as inputs into a classifier with the goal of differentiating the characteristics according to various musical genres.

The majority of algorithms for classifying musical genres make use of low-level spectral characteristics of short-time audio signals (10–100 ms), such as pitch extraction, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and other timbral texture characteristics. The short-term low-level spectral data are then combined with long-term features. The mean and standard deviation of the short time characteristic is the most popular integrating technique.
